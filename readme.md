# Overleaf Template 

For PDF-destined nerd-format writing at overleaf.com.  

Uses the [Overleaf Markdown Package](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/How_to_write_in_Markdown_on_Overleaf) to avoid as much of this Latex insanity as it can. And uses IEEE formatting.  

The primary content is readable for humans in Markdown via [article.md](./article.md).  
(Once complete you might also git-commit the nerd-mode Latex-PDF.)  

Overleaf generally likes one repo per generated PDF to nicely do GitHub-sync.  
Cloning or copying from this repo/project should be a reasonable starting point.
